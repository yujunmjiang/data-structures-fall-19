# Data Structures (Fall 2019)

#### Course Description

This course covers the fundamentals of the database, semi-structured data, and unstructured data. Students will gain familiarity with data visualization concepts, techniques, and tools, including acquisition, augmentation, and restructuring; data storage and aggregation; access to parallel and distributed computing; high-volume data, disparate sources, and performance; and streaming data and real time and dynamic queries.

#### Weekly Assignment 1

1. Using Node.js (in Cloud 9), make a request for each of the ten "Meeting List Agenda" pages for Manhattan. **Important: show the code for all ten requests.** 

2. Using Node.js: For each of the ten files you requested, save the body as a **text file** to your "local" environment (in AWS Cloud9).

3. Study the HTML structure and tags and begin to think about how you might parse these files to extract relevant data for these AA meetings.

4. Update your GitHub repository with the relevant files: your `js` file and ten `txt` files, plus a `md` file with your documentation. In Canvas, submit the URL of the specific location of this work within your `data-structures` GitHub repository.
