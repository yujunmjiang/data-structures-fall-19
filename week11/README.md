#### What will the visualization look like? Will it be interactive? If so, how?
- Users can type a specific date range to search any meeting information that they need in Manhattan area.

#### How will the data need to be mapped to the visual elements?
- The data (showing as text) will be mapped base on latitude and longitude on a map.

#### For that mapping, what needs to be done to the data? Be specific and clear. Will it require filtering, aggregation, restructuring, and/or something else? How will this be done?
- Add week day as filter to search meeting information (e.g. day1, day2, day3...)

#### What is the default view (if any)?
- No location pin on the map before type any date.

#### What assumptions are you making about the user?
- New Yorker need a time and location based meeting map to make the best schedule in their fast-paced life.

#### What will the visualization look like? Will it be interactive? If so, how?
- Users can type a specific date range to search my movie watch history in 2019.

#### How will the data need to be mapped to the visual elements?
- The data (showing as text) will be matched to each movie poster.

#### For that mapping, what needs to be done to the data? Be specific and clear. Will it require filtering, aggregation, restructuring, and/or something else? How will this be done?
- The date chould be either movie release date or the date that I watched movie.

#### What is the default view (if any)?
- All the movie posters on the same page (ordered by date) without text before users make a selection.

#### What assumptions are you making about the user?
- Users can check my movie watch history, reviews (bese on IMDb score), and recommended food/drink (by myself).

#### What will the visualization look like? Will it be interactive? If so, how?
- It is an interactive temperature data archive with date search function.

#### How will the data need to be mapped to the visual elements?
- Users can type a specific date range to review the temperature record base on each date (X-axis) and hourly change (Y-axis).

#### For that mapping, what needs to be done to the data? Be specific and clear. Will it require filtering, aggregation, restructuring, and/or something else? How will this be done?
- Add week day as filter to search meeting information (e.g. day1, day2, day3...)

#### What is the default view (if any)?
- No location pin on the map before type any date.

#### What assumptions are you making about the user?
- New Yorker need a time and location based meeting map to make the best schedule in their fast-paced life.
