* What will the visualization look like? Will it be interactive? If so, how?
* Users can type a specific date range to search any meeting information that they need in Manhattan area.
* How will the data need to be mapped to the visual elements?
* The data (showing as text) will be mapped base on latitude and longitude on a map.
* For that mapping, what needs to be done to the data? Be specific and clear. Will it require filtering, aggregation, restructuring, and/or something else? How will this be done?
* Add week day as filter to search meeting information (e.g. day1, day2, day3...)
* What is the default view (if any)?
* No location pin on the map before type any date.
* What assumptions are you making about the user?
* New Yorker need a time and location based meeting map to make the best schedule in their fast-paced life.
