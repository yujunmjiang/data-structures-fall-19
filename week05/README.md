## Weekly Assignment 05

The start code provide by [Aaron Hill](https://github.com/aaronxhill) can be found [here](https://github.com/visualizedata/data-structures/blob/master/weekly_assignment_05.md)

```javascript
var AWS = require('aws-sdk');
AWS.config = new AWS.Config();
AWS.config.region = "us-east-1";

var dynamodb = new AWS.DynamoDB();

var params = {};
params.Item = blogEntries[0]; 
params.TableName = "processblog";

dynamodb.putItem(params, function (err, data) {
  if (err) console.log(err, err.stack); // an error occurred
  else     console.log(data);           // successful response
});
```

## Solution
**Part One: Plan**

This dataset is about all the movies that have been released in 2019 and my personal watching history. I choose the release date as `partition key` and movie category as `sort key`. The dataset also include movie title, rating, IMDb score, and two related questions (e.g. Did I watch this movie? / What did I eat in the theatre?)
