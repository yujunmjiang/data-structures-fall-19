#### Request Data 

Use variable `urls` to request all the data from 10 AA meeting URLs, and define a constant reference to a value and change the properties of constant objects.

```javascript
const linkPath = '/home/ec2-user/environment/week07/data/';
const fns = ['m01.txt', 'm02.txt', 'm03.txt', 'm04.txt', 'm05.txt', 'm06.txt', 'm07.txt', 'm08.txt', 'm09.txt', 'm10.txt'];
